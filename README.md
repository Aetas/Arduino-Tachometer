# Arduino-Tachometer
Finally getting around to that stray tachometer lead hanging around in the engine bay. As I don't have an oscilloscope and this cable goes for a wild, insulated ride, I don't know if it's carrying a sine wave from the alternator, or a square wave from the ECU. If its a sine wave, I'll probably just throw it into a comparator Op-amp. w/ +5V and 0V in.
